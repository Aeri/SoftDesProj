2D Artillery Game

Our code is split into four files:
main.py - The core of the game engine. Iterates at the specified update rate, controlling movement, player input, and frame updating.
tank.py - Houses the tank object. Handles the movement of the tank's rectangle and changing the tank image. Sends the updated coordinates and parameters back to main to be updated.
projectile.py - Houses the projectile object. Controls the projectile's velocity as a function of time and sends updated coordinates to main to be updated.
terrain.py - Houses the terrain object. Allows the terrain's position to be adjusted on game initialization.

The img folder contains all the necessary images.

The file instructions.pdf gives a tutorial on how to play the game, along with all of the game's controls and weapon types.
