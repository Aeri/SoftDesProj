Overall, we are happy with making a functional and bug-free project.
Our favorite feature of the game is the projectile physics, particularly for the tracking shots.

Overall, we were happy with how we organized our code in different files.
However, as the project advanced, our main file became very unwieldy.
We would like to split the code in the main loop into different methods to be more readable.

If we were to add new features, we would add sound and additional graphics such as explosions and different projectiles.
Stretch features would be adding networked multiplayer and truly deformable terrain.
